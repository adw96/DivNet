Currently we have a detailed vignettes about DivNet and how to use it on phyloseq objects. In addition, we have vignettes covering using DivNet for beta diversity analysis as well as a more conceptual vignette outlining the connection between beta diversity analyses and centroid estimation.

We plan to make more vignettes as we better understand what users of DivNet are likely to need. Feel free to log a feature request under Issues if there is something you would like to see but don't.

[Here](https://github.com/adw96/stamps2018/blob/main/estimation/diversity-lab.R) you will find an interactive tutorial on diversity estimation using [breakaway](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway) and [DivNet](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet).
